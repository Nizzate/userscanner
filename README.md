This is just a really basic http get program I made as a proof of concept. (My first REAL python program)
I'm not really gonna use it outside of PG'ing accounts, but that is a task in itself. 

This just sends http get requests to different roblox apis and sorts the data.

('userID', ''), ('friends', ''), ('followers', ''), ('following', ''), ('username', ''), ('created', ''), ('isBanned', 'false', '', ''), ('hasVerifiedBadge', ''), ('lastOnline', '')

My code is still tons messy so please expect some errors!
